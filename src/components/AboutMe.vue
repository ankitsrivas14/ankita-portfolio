            <p>I am a self-taught designer with a curious mind. I ‚ù§ designing interactions that make technology feel effortless. Building engaging experiences is what drives me. I started my journey in electronics and communications engineering but found solace in designing. And since then worked in three different sectors - Edtech, Delivery-based Startup, and currently in Healthcare.</p>
            <p>My diverse experiences all-around 4 years of graduation have sharpened my skills in research, analysis, and aesthetics. When I finally explored the field of UX, I fell in love with it. I am excited by the process of solving users' problems through designs.</p>
            <p>A strong believer in improving and iterating the problems to achieve the final results.</p>
